# SyncBrowsing

Browse in two tabs at the same time and visually compare websites side by side.

Synchronous browsing is doing the same navigation in two webbrowser windows. If you navigate to some URL in one tab, the second tab also navigates to that (or a similar) URL. By changing the session or URL between the two tabs, you can compare two websites side by side, while clicking through them.

# Installation

* Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Sjord/SyncBrowsing.git`
* Open the Chrome extensions page, under Tools in the menu.
* Enable "Developer mode" checkbox.
* Click "Load unpackged extension..."
* Select the `SyncBrowsing` directory you cloned into.
* Enable the "Allow in incognito" if you want to have a separate session in the other tab.
